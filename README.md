# ECE 5770 Final Project

TODOs:
Further comparisons: 
- Versions of kernels with certain optimization techniques NOT used to demonstrate impact
- #pragma approach with compiler directives for comparison
- multithreaded C/C++ implementation with timing benchmarks for comparison 
- Potentially benchmark python execution during data prep phase for another sequential bulletpoint, but also that might be accelerated under the hood.
